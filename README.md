# Team 3 - Comet Courier

A simple, campus-only ride share. Students already driving to campus offer seats; other students request a pickup within a time window. Lower cost, quick matches, school-verified users.

## What it is
- **For students** commuting to/from campus
- **Drivers** post their commute window + seats
- **Riders** request a pickup and confirm via quick chat
- **Matches** are based on time overlap and small detours
- **Safety basics**: school email verification, ratings, report/block
